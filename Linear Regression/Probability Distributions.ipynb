    "In a frequentist treatment, we choose specific values for the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as the likelihood function. By contrast, in a Bayesian treatment we introduce prior distributions over the parameters and then use Bayesâ€™ theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution given the observed data.    \n",
