    "### Where should we put the knots? \n",
    "The regression spline is most flexible in regions that contain a lot of knots, because in those regions the polynomial coefficients can change rapidly. Hence, one option is to place more knots in places where we feel the function might vary most rapidly, and to place fewer knots where it seems more stable. In practice, we cand place knots at uniform quantiles of the data.  \n",
    "### How many knots should we use or equivalently how many degrees of freedom should our spline contain? \n",
    "=> Use **Cross-validation**: we remove a portion of the data (say 10%), fit a spline with a certain number of knots to the remaining data, and then use the spline to make predictions for the held-out portion. We repeat this process multiple times until each observation has been left out once, and then compute the overall cross-validated RSS. This procedure can be repeated for different numbers of knotsK. Then the value of $K$ giving the smallest RSS is chosen.\n",

    "### Comparison to Polynomial Regression? \n",
    "Regression splines often give superior results to polynomial regression. \n",
    "1. Because Polynomials must use a high degree to produce flexible fits, splines introduce flexibility by increasing the number of knots but keeping the degree fixed. So generally this approach produces more stable estimates.   \n",
    "2.  Splines also allow us to place more knots, and hence flexibility, over regions where the function $f$ seems to be changing rapidly, and fewer knots where $f$ appears more stable."
