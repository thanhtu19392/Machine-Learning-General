    "### 1. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "PCA is a technique for reducing the dimension of a $n$ x $p$ data matrix $X$.    \n",
    "   \n",
    "The *first principal component* $Z_1$ direction of the data is that along which the observations vary the most. It means if we projected the observations onto this line, the resulting projected observations would have the largest possible variance . Hence, the first principal component vector defines the line that is as close as possible to the data.    \n",
    "   \n",
    "The *second principal component* $Z_2$ is a linear combinations of the varibales that is uncorrelated with $Z_1$ (means $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are perpendicular) and has largest variance subject to this constraint.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "So if we look carefully, we realize that this process is similar as Singular Vectors in SVD.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. Principal Components Regression Approach \n",
    "The *principal components regression (PCR)* approach involves constructing principal components regression the first M principal components $Z_1,...,Z_M$ and then using these components as the predictors in a linear regression model that is fit using least squares. The key idea is that often a small number of principal components suffice to explain most of the variability in the data, as well as the relationship with the response.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "Assuming that the directions in which $X_1,...,X_p$ show the most variation are the directions that are associated with target Y.  So fitting a least squares model to $Z_1,...,Z_M$ will lead to better results than fitting a least squares model to $X_1,...X_p$ since most or all of the information in the data that relates to the response is contained in $Z_1,...Z_M$ and by estimating only $M<<p$ coefficients we can mitigate overfitting.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "PCR will tend to do well in cases when the first few principal components are sufficient to capture most of the variation in the predictors as well as the relationship with the response. So that we will fit model using these few principal components and eliminate the others.  \n",
    "The bias drops to zero rapidly and the variances increase as M increases\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that even though PCR provides a simple way to perform regression using $M<p$ predictors, it is not a feature selection method. This is because each of the M principal components used in the regression is a linear combination of all p of theoriginal features."

This is barely fewer than $M = 22$, which amounts to simply performing least squares, because when all of the components are used in PCR no dimension reduction occurs. However, from the plot we also see that the cross-validation error is roughly the same when only one component is included in the model.

    "## Partial Least Squares\n",
    "The PCR approach that we just described involves identifying linear combinations, or directions, that best represent the predictors $X_1, . . . , X_p$. These directions are identified in an *unsupervised way*, since the response $Y$ is not used to help determine the principal component directions. That is, the response does not *supervise* the identification of the principal components.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Consequently, PCR suffers from a drawback: there is no guarantee that the\n",
    "directions that best explain the predictors will also be the best directions to use for predicting the response.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "Partial least squares (PLS) is a supervised alternative to PCR. Like $PCR$, $PLS$ is a dimension reduction method, which first identifies squares a new set of features $Z_1, . . . , Z_M$ that are linear combinations of the original features, and then fits a linear model via least squares using these M new features. But unlike PCR, PLS identifies these new features in a supervised way—that is, it makes use of the response Y in order to identify new features that not only approximate the old features well, but also that are related to the response.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Algorithm:**  \n",
    "1. Standardize each $x_j$ to have mean zero and variance one. Set $\\hat{y}^{(0)} = y_1$ and $\\hat{x}^{(0)} = x_1$  \n",
    "2. For m =1,2...,p  \n",
    "    (a) $z_m = \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^p \\hat\\varphi_{mj}x_j^{m-1}$, where $\\hat\\varphi_{mj} = <x_j^{m-1},y>$  \n",
    "    (b) $\\hat\\phi_m = \\frac{<z_m, y>}{<z_m, z_m>} $   \n",
    "    (c) $\\hat{y}^{(m)} = \\hat{y}^{(m)}+ \\hat\\phi_mz_m$  \n",
    "    (d) Orthogonalize each x_j^{(m-1)} with respect to $z_m$: $x_j^{(m)} = x_j^{(m-1)} - [\\frac{<z_m, x_j^{(m-1)}>}{<z_m, z_m>}]z_m $, $j = 1,2...,p$  \n",
    "3. Output the sequence of fitted vectors $({\\hat{y}^{(m)}})_1^p$.Since the $({z_l})_1^p$ are linear in the original $x_j$, so is $\\hat{y}^{(m)} = X\\hat\\beta^{pls}(m)$. These linear coefficients can be recovered from the sequence of PLS transformations.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "**Comments:**  \n",
    "The partial least squares seeks directions that have high variance and have high correlation with the response, in contrast to principal components regression which keys only on high variance."
